description: Think deeply and review project guidelines
---

Take a moment to think deeply and carefully re-read @CLAUDE.md. Pay special attention to:
- The critical instructions section at the top
- "Let's X" means "let's discuss X" - NOT "do X now"
- NEVER commit without explicit user request
- Git workflow requirements
- Code style guidelines
- Project-specific conventions

Fully internalize these guidelines before proceeding.
